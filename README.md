  You've now completed setting up and json server is now running in your local system!

  Deploy the same in any online deployment platform so that it can be used and accessed by anyone!

  I'm using Heroku! you're free to use any tool  :)

  ---

  Up your current project again using this command npm init
  - Incase you're too lazy dev, use npm init -y (npm will not ask any questions for you, it will just generate the package.json file for you! :)

  add all details if required or you can just leave the details as default, a package.json file will now be added to the working repository with all the details entered

  ---

  Check if your package is up by running npm i in your current project directory working terminal , and start your json server again by typing this command npm i json-server
  
  ---
  
  add git ignore
  
  ---

  install heroku

  ---
Run this command npm install -g heroku to check if Heroku is installed properly on your device. 
Check Heroku version by typing this command heroku --version

---

Now create a Heroku project by typing this command in your current project working directory
heroku create my-burger-api

You'll be asked to signin, a page will be redirected to you over the browser to sigin in case if you've not signed in earlier using the CLI.

Or you can simply login using this command heroku login
---

Two links will now be shown in the termincal such as " your-project-link.herokuapp.com " , "git.heroku.com/your-project-name"

---

Push the current project to heroku using git push heroku main
